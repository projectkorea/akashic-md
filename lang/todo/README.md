# ToDo-App

- Welcome to the Multilingual ToDo App repository! This repository houses a collection of ToDo applications implemented in various programming languages. Each implementation demonstrates the core functionalities of a ToDo app, including Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations.
- Our goal is to provide simple yet effective examples of how ToDo apps can be built in different programming languages, serving as a learning resource and a coding exercise for developers of all levels.

5. **Feedback**

## Learning Approach

- **Code Comparison**: Compare how the same functionality is implemented across different languages.
- **Refactoring Practice**: Read through the code, refactor it for better readability and efficiency.
- **Re-coding**: Delete the implementation and try coding it again from scratch to reinforce learning.
- **Study and Enhance**: Google for any unknown concepts, study them, and add more features to the app.

## Contribution Guidelines

- We encourage contributions from the community! If you'd like to add a new language implementation or improve an existing one, please follow these steps:
