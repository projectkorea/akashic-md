### 1. Typescript (01~05)

1. js와 ts의 관계 이해하기
2. ts 설정 이해하기
3. 컴파일과 타입 시스템은 독립적이다
4. 구조적 타이핑 익숙해지기
5. any 타입 지양하기

### 2. Type System (06~18)

The type system is at the heart of TypeScript. It allows you to define and enforce types, providing compile-time checks that help catch errors early in the development process. You'll learn about:

6. ts 언어 서비스
7. Type annotations and type inference
8. Interfaces and type aliases
9. Union and intersection types
10. Enums and literals

### 3. Type Inference 

TypeScript's type inference capabilities can save you time and effort by automatically deducing types from your code. You'll explore how TypeScript infers types and how to leverage this feature to write cleaner and more concise code.

- 함수 표현식에 타입 적용하기
- 타입과 인터페이스의 차이
- 타입 연산과 제너릭 사용으로 반복 줄이기
- 동적 데이터에 인덱스 시그니처 사용하기
- number 인덱스 시그니처보다는 Array, 튜플, ArrayLike 사용하기
- 변경 관련된 오류 방지를 위해 readonly 사용하기
- 매핑된 탕입을 사용하여 값 동기화하기

### 4. Type Design

Designing types effectively is crucial for maintaining a clean and scalable codebase. This section covers best practices and principles for type design, including:

- Creating reusable and composable types
- Balancing strictness and flexibility
- Using generics to create type-safe abstractions

### 5. Working with `any`

While `any` can be a convenient escape hatch, overusing it can undermine TypeScript's benefits. Learn how to minimize the use of `any` and employ safer alternatives like unknown, generics, and conditional types.

### 6. Types Declarations and `@types`

Type declarations provide type information for existing JavaScript libraries. You'll learn how to:

- Use DefinitelyTyped and the `@types` scope
- Write your own type declaration files
- Manage type dependencies

### 7. Writing and Running Your Code

Discover the best practices for writing and running TypeScript code, including:

- Setting up a TypeScript project
- Configuring the TypeScript compiler (tsconfig.json)
- Integrating with build tools and task runners
- Debugging TypeScript code

### 8. Migrating to TypeScript

Migrating an existing JavaScript codebase to TypeScript can be daunting. This section provides a step-by-step guide to:

- Planning your migration
- Gradually introducing TypeScript
- Handling common challenges and pitfalls

---

By the end of this guide, you'll have a solid understanding of TypeScript and how to use it effectively in your projects. Whether you're new to TypeScript or looking to deepen your knowledge, this guide has something for you. Let's get started and unlock the full potential of TypeScript!
